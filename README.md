###Customer Churn Prediction System###
This project is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning application designed to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave). It includes a data science workflow for model training and a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

###Project Overview###
Objective: To identify high-risk customers.
Model: Developed using Python, focusing on preprocessing, feature scaling, and classification.
Deployment: A user-friendly web interface that allows for manual data entry to get instant churn results.

###Tech Stack###
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn (Preprocessing, Scalers, and Classifiers)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Web Framework: Streamlit
Model Storage: Pickle

###Repository Structure###
best.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, feature engineering, and model training.
Main.py: The Python script for the Streamlit web application.
churn_model.pkl: The serialized pre-trained Machine Learning model.
